## Introduction

This guide is aimed at anyone that would be interested in trying to play in the Any% NMG (No Major Glitches) category. A lot of information in this guide can be used for other categories but the differences won't be explained here.

> When souls count or mana usage is mentioned, the guide assume that the game is in Advanced difficulty, anything that works in Advanced can also work in Standard.

I highly recommend checking you the movements and combats videos that I made that complement this guide with useful general knowledge, meanwhile this guide focuses more on the route and the content of the run itself.

I would also recommend to check the runs on *[speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/little_witch_nobeta)* and to compare them even if they don't necessarily contain the latest techs and routes, sometimes it's easier to understand something with a video example.  
I have also done a complete *[Any% NMG WR Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlDkyTH6TiM&list=PLX-WkeHPvTEy8DhkUkb_UUJxz0aRXCtCf&index=3&t=6313s&pp=gAQBiAQB)* that explains everything that is right and wrong with the WR in this category *(as of the writing of this guide)*. I will often refer to this video since it is timestamped and provide examples for most of the latest discoveries.

## Settings and controls

First and foremost, 

### Cursor Indicator

## Okun Shrine

Okun Shrine is the first level of the game, it is a short but contains a lot of possible micro-optimizations.

This level starts when you confirm the difficulty setting on the new game screen. You will have two cutscenes to skip in a row which will help you to train your cutscene skip timing. A good time is having a sub 2 seconds timer after the first cutscene.

> _A few notes on skipping cutscenes_
>
> When using keyboard + mouse, you have the choice to either click on the confirm skip button by using the mouse or using the keyboard. Both methods are good and it will really depends on your own feeling and on the situation you are in. For cutscenes after a long loading screen or transition I prefer to use the keyboard, for others I use the mouse.
>
> Be careful of trying to open the skip cutscene menu too fast! It is possible to get in a "softlock" state by opening the menu just after a cutscene starts. Seeing the normal pause menu open instead of the cutscene skip menu is an indicator that you reached this softlock state. The only way to get out easily is to die, which is not necessarily possible in all situations and may make you lose a lot of time. The only way to avoid this is to wait a bit before trying to skip cutscenes. _(Note that some cutscenes can never lead to a softlock, for examples those that are triggered after X seconds like cutscenes after killing a boss)_

### [First Barrier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHPPDXbgu5s&t=0)

After the two cutscenes, the objective is to reach the first barrier while optimizing your stamina usage (you can refer to [this part of the Movements Guide video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ewwr3Cm8EU&t=557s) for tips on stamina management).

Firstly, past the statue by going either a bit right or left of it depending on your preferences and then turn right. You want to do as many aerial attacks as possible by jumping off the stairs to save stamina.  
One enemy will launch a projectiles at you, either shoot at him to cancel/kill him or dodge by moving a bit to the left. Then continue past him without stopping until you reach the "lightning trap trigger" _(c.f. image below)_. You should be able to reach this point without having to recover stamina once.

> Collider to trigger the lightning trap, marked by the inner blue collider and the red line

Once you reach this point, you can stop running to recover some stamina but continue moving forward by entering the next corridor. You won't get hit by the lightning traps if you're not running (which you can't do anyway since you need to regenerate stamina). Start running again when you get close to 75% stamina, you can wait for a bit more if it feels easier to you.

Go to the right at end of the corridor, do the two jumps on the platforms and reach the crystal that maintains the magic barrier. The easiest way to destroy this crystal is to jump, do two aerial melee attacks, do an arcane shot and then do a triple melee attacks on the ground followed by another single shot.  

### [Rescue Cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHPPDXbgu5s&t=61)

Skip the cutscene after destroying the crystal. Now it is best to get the bag extension upgrade otherwise you won't be able to do a few things later on. To get this upgrade, jump on the crystal pedestal, jump on the stone fence, then jump extension toward the chest directly. Otherwise you find it hard to perform (which it is), you can go back down the stairs and reach the platform using a simple jump extension (double aerial attack after a single jump).

> _Notes on jumping on crystal pedestals_
>
> It can be quite hard at first to jump onto the crystal pedestals while being in a running state. One easy way to achieve this is to do the inputs next to the pedestal in this order: `jump > wait a tiny bit > hold forward > toggle sprint`. The key point is to move forward when you reach the maximum height of the jump, this way you will correctly land on the pedestal instead of jumping over it.
>
> Remember this since it will be used again later in the run.

To open the chest, the fastest way is to open if using the aerial attack that you used to reach this platform. This advanced technique is quite hard to do and not recommended at first. The other standard way is to open the chest using a normal melee attack on the ground and to cancel its animation by shooting a single arcane projectile. This is faster than waiting for the melee animation to end.

Before running again and going down after collecting the bag expansion, be sure to have enough stamina to reach the next cutscene, which requires at least around 60% stamina. Do not jump over the platform, this will waste stamina, instead let yourself fall down.

Go toward the next statue while paying attention to one enemy that can shoot at you, either strafe on a side to dodge (you can use the sound cue to know when to sidestep) or shoot at him to cancel his attack. Go left to go downstairs and run till you reach the big blue mana crystal.

Hit at least once the mana crystal using an aerial melee attack and trigger the cutscene. Skip the cutscene.  
Start charging Arcane and wait to recover a bit of stamina. Once your stamina bar stops blinking red, jump to do two aerial melee attacks on the mana crystal. Jump again to do two more melee attacks. Shoot the charged Arcane when the barrier crystal is about to spawn and land on the ground to charge another Arcane. You then need to jump to do two more aerial melee attacks on the crystal but you need to wait for your arcane magic to be charged before that, otherwise the mana orbs won't spawn. Shoot the charged Arcane while still in the air and then run directly towards the next corridor after the two melee attacks. Shoot the last charged Arcane whenever it is ready. Skip the cutscene.

> [Video example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHPPDXbgu5s&t=87)

Run towards the next cutscene, the colliders for cutscenes are rectangle so run in a straight line, no need to reposition in the middle of the corridor. Skip the cutscene.

This part can be quite tricky and the placement of the enemies is chosen randomly from a few predetermined patterns so sometimes things don't go well. The gist of this fight is to get the aggro of the two enemies that are attacking the cat, kill the two enemies on the right using headshots, break the jars that contain mana orbs and then finish all the others using a charged Arcane. Using a cursor indicator at the center of your screen will help greatly for this part, see [Cursor Indicator](#cursor-indicator) for more information.

### [Armor Start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHPPDXbgu5s&t=133)

This is the last platforming part of Okun Shrine, leading to the first boss of the game. After the cat rescue cutscene, head upstairs while killing the enemy there. Then jump on the stone fence on the left and jump left around the pillar. If you correctly disable the running state while jumping around the pillar, Nobeta will do a "quick recovery" which allows you to start regenerating stamina way faster than usual when touching the ground. Wait to have around 50% stamina (wait for more if you struggle getting to the Armor without tripping) stamina to start running again.

Go to the right and jump on the stone fence in front of you to go directly towards the last statue. A good indicator to know where to jump to get over the fence is to jump just before the "lighter stone" on the ground, the one that has a touch of white. Use a jump extension after jumping over the barrier to save your stamina and go around the statue down the stairs. End with another jump extension down the stairs to reach the cutscene trigger, bonus point if you manage to use the trip animation to trigger the cutscene since Nobeta's velocity during the trip animation is higher than when running.

### [Armor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHPPDXbgu5s&t=171)

This is by far the easiest boss in the game but the randomness of the fight may make you lose a bit of time and you can't really do anything about it. This boss has a weakpoint that you will need to aim at: the base of his body (the purple flame). It is also easy to stagger this boss using Arcane shots so that's a reliable way to kill him easily without any specific strategy.

The fastest strategy is:
- Shoot the left jar on the left wall and charge Arcane. Pray for Armor to do an attack that will allow you to easily hit his weakpoint (best one is the charged slash).
- Shoot the charged Arcane at his weakpoint and immediately destroy the left jar on the right wall.
- Profit from the fact that he's staggered to shoot a few non-charged Arcane shots at his weakpoint (6 shots is ideal).
- Start charging immediately and do a triple melee attack combo
- Shoot the charged Arcane whenever possible while aiming at the jar behind the boss on the left (the charged Arcane projectile will go through the boss and break the jar if aimed correctly)
- Shoot twice with non-charged Arcane shots (you can sometimes shoot a third time here but if you're too slow the boss will enter in a defensive state which you don't want to happen)
- Start charging Arcane and do three melee attacks
- Shoot the last charged Arcane as soon as possible
- Finish the boss using non-charged Arcane magic if he's low, otherwise charge another Arcane

> For this strategy to work, you need to hit the correct jars since for each group of jar, one of them gives more mana than the other. Always break the one with the most mana (or even both).
>
> For some reason the Armor sometimes waits 2-3 seconds before starting any attack pattern, that's why the linked split is +3.1 sec from best split although it is nearly perfect.

Congratulations, you already completed one of the six levels of the game!

## Livesplit and record setup

Now that you are ready to start running the game, don't forget to setup Livesplit and a recording software to be able to submit your times on *[speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/little_witch_nobeta)* !

It is best to simplify the work of the moderators on *[speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/little_witch_nobeta)* to setup Livesplit correctly with the autosplitter to display the *Load Removed Time* which is the time without counting all the loading screens to make it fair for everyone since loading times vary greatly depending on the hardware your playing on.

There are a lot of guides on how to setup Livesplit but the gist of it is:
- Create the splits and enable the Autosplitter by setting the game title to "Little Witch Nobeta" in the splits edit menu
- Create or use an existing layout which can be personalized to your preferences

A video proof of your run is also required to submit a run on the leaderboard, you can use any software to record your game but I would recommend to use [OBS (Open Broadcaster Software®)](https://obsproject.com/fr/) as it is free, open source and easy to use while being highly customizable if you're a more advanced user.
